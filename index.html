	<h2>Cryptography Definition</h2>
	<p>
		Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient 
		of a message to view its contents.

		The term is derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means hidden. It is closely associated to encryption, 
		which is the act of scrambling ordinary text into what's known as ciphertext and then back again upon arrival.
		In addition, cryptography also covers the obfuscation of information in images using techniques such as microdots or merging. Ancient Egyptians were known to use these methods in complex hieroglyphics, and Roman Emperor Julius Caesar is credited with using one of the first modern ciphers.
