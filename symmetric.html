	<h2>How Symmetric Key Encryption Algorithms Work</h2>
	<h3>Symmetric Key Cryptography</h3>
	<p>
		An encryption system in which the sender and receiver of a message share a single, common key that is 
		used to encrypt and decrypt the message. The most popular symmetric–key system is the Data Encryption Standard (DES).

				<p>
					In Cryptography, a transposition cipher is a method of encryption by which the positions held by units of 
					plaintext (which are commonly characters or groups of characters) are shifted according to a regular system, 
					so that the ciphertext constitutes a permutation of the plaintext.
				</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>
					Method of encryption by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; 
					the “units” may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, 
					and so forth.

				<p>
					Symmetric or secret-key encryption algorithm that encrypts a single bit at a time. With a Stream Cipher, 
					the same plaintext bit or byte will encrypt to a different bit or byte every time it is encrypted.
				</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>
					An encryption method that applies a deterministic algorithm along with a symmetric key to encrypt 
					a block of text, rather than encrypting one bit at a time as in stream ciphers.
