	<h2>Encryption Algorithms</h2>
	<p>
		Cryptography is broadly classified into two categories: Symmetric key Cryptography and Asymmetric key 
		Cryptography (popularly known as public key cryptography).
	</p>
	<img src="encryption.png" width="1000">
	<p>
		Now Symmetric key Cryptography is further categorized as Classical Cryptography and Modern Cryptography.
	</p>
	<p>
		Further drilling down, Classical Cryptography is divided into Transposition Cipher and Substitution Cipher. 
		On the other hand, Modern Cryptography is divided into Stream Cipher and Block Cipher.
