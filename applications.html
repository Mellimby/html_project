	<h2>Applications of Cryptography</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Secure communications</dt>
		<dd>
		<p>
			The most obvious use of cryptography, and the one that all of us use frequently, is encrypting communications 
			between us and another system. This is most commonly used for communicating between a client program and a server.
			Examples are a web browser and web server, or email client and email server. When the internet was developed it 
			was a small academic and government community, and misuse was rare. Most systems communicated in the clear 
			(without encryption), so anyone who intercepted network traffic could capture communications and passwords. 
			Modern switched networks make interception harder, but some cases – for example, public wifi – still allow it. 
			To make the internet more secure, most communication protocols have adopted encryption. Many older protocols 
			have been dropped in favour of newer, encrypted replacements.

		<dt>End-to-end Encryption</dt>
		<dd>
		<p>
			Email is one area where encryption is not widely in use. When email moves from server to server, and from server 
			to you, it is encrypted. On the mail server and on your system, however, an administrator can read it. There 
			are options to implement “end-to-end” encryption for email (I use PGP) but email systems are complex and these
			options are complex. Truly secure messaging systems – where only the sender and receiver can read the message –
			are those where encryption has been built in from the start. Whatsapp is good; Signal is better.

		<dt>Storing Data</dt>
		<dd>
		<p>
			We all store a large amount of data, and any data is valuable to at least the person who generated it. 
			Every operating system uses encryption in some of the core components to keep passwords secret, conceal some 
			parts of the system, and make sure that updates and patches are really from the maker of the system.
		</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>Storing Passwords</dt>
		<dd>
		<p>
			In the last blog post I briefly introduced cryptographic hashing, a one-way mapping of a string to a 
			fixed-length value. One of the main uses of this is to store passwords. It is very risky to store passwords 
			in an accessible way. If stored in plaintext on a system, anyone who has access to the system – legitimate 
			or malicious – can read the password. Encryption is only a partial answer to storing passwords. If someone 
			has access to the system storing the encrypted passwords, they will probably have access to the encryption 
			key to decrypt the password. Hashing, on the other hand, produces a relatively useless value for the attacker. 
			A system will take the password on login, hash it, and compare to the hashed value. At no point will the system –
			or an attacker – have access to the plaintext password.
